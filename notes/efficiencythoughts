the cost of a kernel evaluation is concentrated in the sqrt
intel mkl and intel vml allow vectorization of certain operations.
floats are faster than doubles by a decent margin.
using exact integration methods makes single precision floating
point more attractive.
how much do i need the extra digits of precision?
gpu computing should be straightforward and very fast
python mpi4py
avx and sse vectorization should give a decent speedup
