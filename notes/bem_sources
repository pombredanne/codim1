Books:
Crouch and Starfield book.
Sauter, Schwab has a lot of theory -- pretty dense!

The steinbach (2008) book is in my references directory and has useful info -- 
looks somewhat theoretical but probably splits the middle ground between 
crouch/starfield and sauter/schwab

Sauter, schwab quadrature methods look exciting!
The implementation in BEM++ using the borrowed HYENA code looks promising. 
Porting that would provide the necessary routines.
Definitely what I should do for 3D

www.boundaryelements.com has many examples and tutorials including for 
elasticity specifically
The book provided there is probably the best that I have found:

http://www.boundary-element-method.com/ -- haven't looked at it

Implementation of BEM methods:
BETL
BEM++
HYENA @ http://portal.tugraz.at/portal/page/portal/Files/i2610/files/Forschung/Software/HyENA/html/index.html
-- HYENA is an excellent source of information... and uses the same style of
    implementation used here.
-- lovely quote: "Up to now only integration routines for three space dimensions are implemented. The reason is that no to us known coordinate transformation is available for the integration of weakly singular kernels in two space dimensions. Beside that the respective regularized fundamental solutions are missing too."

EPSBEM -- super high order approximations using matlab (p > 10000!!!!)

Other notes:

The MIT OCW 16.920 has some good notes on boundary element methods.

Cruse 1969 is a clear explanation of the direct method for 3D
I haven't yet obtained the accompanying 2D paper -- Rizzo 1967

Add info on dense matrix compression techniques 
-- H-matrices, FMM, Panel clustering, Barnes-Hut
-- AHMED, HLIB, hmmvp (Andrew Bradley) -- h matrix implementations

Fast multipole boundary element method -- http://urbana.mie.uc.edu/yliu/Software/

Add info on dense parallelizable matrix solvers.

Add info on the sparse parallel approximate preconditioner

MAGMA, PLASMA from Univ. Tennessee look like interesting multi-architecture
linear algebra packages.

Eventually I will add some notes on BEM to this directory.
