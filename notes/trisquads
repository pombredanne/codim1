tris are more commonly produced from meshing procedures and i will frequently 
need to use triangular meshes.
but, quads are easier to use in many many ways -- tensor product effect.
2d quadrilateral meshing is a mostly solved problem.
triangle->quadrilateral meshing is performed successfully by the Q-morph 
algorithm.
no reason to screw with tris if I don't need to.
