black box fmm looks worthwhile.
i should explore how to extend it to the high order case with just lumping
elements. maybe a two tiered iteraction list and M2L...
interaction between the element nodes and the fmm nodes is complex and
interesting

tree code options:
exafmm extraction
write my own
p4est?
need a way to separate element subdivision in refinement from the fmm tree
