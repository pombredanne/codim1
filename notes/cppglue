A common pitfall is that boost python expects classes to have copy 
constructors. If the class isn't copyable, use boost::noncopyable.

Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics has a tools called CIGMA
that does some boost python numpy work. Look here, for some useful
functions.

PyUblas seems like a useful way of bridging the gap between numpy arrays
and c++ fast data access.

There is some slow down for array access... but negligible compared to 
the value added. And seemingly fixable.
PyUblas still looks like it makes it easier to get the raw double array
out of numpy anyway.
