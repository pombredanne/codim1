 use schur complement approach -- results in a positive definite symmetric matrix
 also easy to couple to a finite element discretization
 smaller system to solve
 also, improved conditioning (according to some sources)
it's okay to compute the entire schur complement unlike in the 
finite element case because the matrix is already dense.
