Attempting to rewire the integration interface so it can go through one
simple mediator class that takes an element as an input.
There are 6 different places that interact with the integration layer.
These are all in the assembly layer.
1. Matrix -- double integrals over pairs of element bases
2. rhs -- double integrals over an element and a function
3. point source rhs -- single integral over basis and point source strgth
4. massmatrix -- single integral over pairs of bases on one element
5. constraints -- single integral over element basis
6. interior point -- single integral over element with test basis being
    one at the interior point location

All these integrals require different quadrature rules. This can be easily
accomodated within one routine. But, what if I want to use an analytic 
formula for certain integrals?

For the rhs integrals, I want to integrate a singular thing over a very 
large area (the whole mesh!). Should I do this elementwise like I am now,
or could it be done globally with one function. I think it has to be done
elementwise because of the piecewise definition of the mesh.

I think I should get rid of the class form and turn these all into 
functions. They aren't objects in any sense of the word normally
