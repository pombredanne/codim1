To get setup:
Install vagrant. Go here and follow the directions: http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html

Run the commands:
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh

You are now at a bash prompt within the Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64 instance created. Play!

The directory structure for the project is at "/vagrant" so to run the code:
    cd /vagrant
    ipython source/filename.py
