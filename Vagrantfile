  # Every Vagrant virtual environment requires a box to build off of.
  config.vm.box = "precise64"

  # The url from where the 'config.vm.box' box will be fetched if it
  # doesn't already exist on the user's system.
  config.vm.box_url = "http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box"

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.100.100"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network :public_network

  # If true, then any SSH connections made will enable agent forwarding.
  # Default value: false
  # config.ssh.forward_agent = true

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
    # Don't boot with headless mode
    # vb.gui = true
  
    # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
    # Allow 4GB of RAM 
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "4096"]

    # Allows 64bit guests and multiple cores
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--ioapic", "on"]

    # Use two cores.
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpus", "4"]   

    vb.name = "codim1"
  end

  # Setup ansible provisioning.
  config.vm.provision "ansible" do |ansible|

    ansible.playbook = "./deploy/ansible_playbook.yml"
