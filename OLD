To get setup:

Get the code
    git clone https://github.com/tbenthompson/codim1.git

Install virtualbox. 
    Go here and follow the directions: https://www.virtualbox.org/

Install ansible, preferably through pip: 
    http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-pip

Install vagrant. Go here and follow the directions: 
    http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html

Run the commands (the first command may take quite a while, and may ask for
your password at some point):
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh

You are now at a bash prompt within the Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64 instance created. Play!
--It is currently configured to use 1GB of RAM and allowed access to 2 cores.
--You can check to make sure that the machine is configured correctly by
running the "source/test_speed.py" script. It should run the same speed inside
and outside the virtual machine.

The directory structure for the project is at "/vagrant" so to run the code:
    cd /vagrant
    ipython -i source/filename.py

When you're done, there are multiple options for dealing with the Vagrant 
instance:
1. If you don't mind using a bit of disk space, you can just suspend the 
machine with "vagrant suspend". This will store all the RAM to disk. This is 
basically just like a suspend with your normal OS.
2. Otherwise, "vagrant halt" will perform a shut down. 
3. Finally, "vagrant destroy" will completely delete the virtual machine. The
next time you use the machine will require re-running the "vagrant up" command
and waiting for it to finish again.

The next time you update the code, to update the virtual machine configuration,
either "destroy" and "up" again (slow) or "vagrant reload" (fast).
